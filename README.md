### Services

* **API Service:**
    * Provides RESTful endpoints for interacting with the Bookstore API.
    * Handles API requests and responses.
    * Manages database interactions.
* **Notification Service:**
    * Sends real-time notifications to users using websockets.
    * Utilizes a message queue (RabbitMQ) for asynchronous notifications.
* **Recommendation Service:**
    * Generates personalized book recommendations based on user data.
    * Integrates with OpenAI for advanced natural language processing.

### Database

The application uses a MySQL database to store information about books, users, and other data.

* **Tables:**
    * `books`: Stores book details, including title, author, genre, ISBN, etc.
    * `users`: Stores user accounts, including usernames, passwords, and preferences.
    * `ratings`: Stores user ratings for books.
    * `reviews`: Stores user reviews for books.
    * `recommendations`: Stores personalized book recommendations.

### Messaging

The application utilizes RabbitMQ for asynchronous message passing between different services.

* **Message Queue:**
    * The notification service uses RabbitMQ to send notifications asynchronously.
    * The recommendation service uses RabbitMQ to process recommendations in the background.
* **Message Consumers:**
    * The notification service subscribes to the notification queue.
    * Background tasks process messages from the recommendation queue.

### Routers

The API service defines various routes to provide access to the application's functionality.

* **Book Routes:**
    * `/api/books`: Get a list of books.
    * `/api/books/<book_id>`: Get details for a specific book.
    * `/api/books/search`: Search for books by keywords.
    * `/api/books/add`: Add a new book.
    * `/api/books/<book_id>/update`: Update a book.
    * `/api/books/<book_id>/delete`: Delete a book.
* **User Routes:**
    * `/api/users`: Get a list of users (admin only).
    * `/api/users/<user_id>`: Get details for a specific user.
    * `/api/users/register`: Create a new user account.
    * `/api/users/login`: Log in to an existing account.
    * `/api/users/<user_id>/update`: Update user profile.
* **Recommendation Routes:**
    * `/api/recommendations`: Get personalized book recommendations.
* **Notification Routes:**
    * `/api/notifications`: Receive real-time notifications.
* **File Upload Routes:**
    * `/api/upload`: Upload book files (PDFs).

### AI Integration

The application utilizes OpenAI for advanced language processing tasks, such as:

* **Generating book summaries:** Summarizing book descriptions to provide concise information.
* **Generating recommendations:** Recommending books based on user preferences and book content.
* **Creating book descriptions:** Auto-generating descriptions for books based on their content.

### API Documentation

The API documentation is provided using Swagger or another suitable documentation tool. This documentation outlines the available endpoints, request and response structures, and usage examples.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:** 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bookstore-api.git
    ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd bookstore-api
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Configure environment variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
    * Set the necessary environment variables as specified in the `config.py` file.
4. **Set up the database:**
    * Create a MySQL database and configure the connection details in the `.env` file.
